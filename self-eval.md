# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
The part where we had an array of hashes was a bit daunting, but I just tried to slow down and not get overwhelmed and understand it bit by bit. This really helped and I understood it pretty quickly!
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I've always been a huge notetaker, I need to write things down to really process things, otherwise it goes in one ear and out the other. I'm finding taking notes helpful at all times. It allows me to reflect on what is important to remember rather than glazing over them.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Generally I try to solve a problem on my own first, I feel like most of the new challenges we are given we have generally been given the tools to problem solve and figure out the answer or get really close. Often times I am just googling a syntax issue or the name of a method I don't know.
